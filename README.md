# FATL-Game
Software Engineering FATL Game

Jason Notes 10/30/18
- While the main files go in your src workspace folder, the images associated and called upon from the game go in the bin folder
   - (This is for eclipse, not sure about other IDE's)
- Make sure you import all the javaFX stuff as you go and add more
